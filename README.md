# SVG logo
Challenge 10 implements more JavaScript code, but also includes inquirer and jest.  Jest was used in a test file of code I created to ensure everything was functioning and running without issue. Inquirer was used to help with my command line interface.  This demonstrates my continued knowledge with JavaScript and modules that can be used with it.  It also demonstrates my knowledge with creating content, navigation, and testing through the terminal.  With this I created a logo maker so anyone can pick from three shapes, any color they input, and three characters to create their own custom "logo."

## Acknowledgements
JD - Senior Software Developer
    I would like to thank JD helped me figure out why my shapes werent 200px by 300px and why my text was not centering.  He introduced an addon in visual studio code, SVG Viewer, that helped me figure out the exact values I wanted for the genrated logos. He also gave me the code on my index.js file line 96 which created a "timestamp" and with that new code I was able to create a new file for every logo using that const value so they were all unique.
